Tinder-like feature with streaks maintenance for Myntra-HackerRamp 

This project is a clone of the Myntra homepage with added features to enhance the user experience. The primary focus is on a new way of exploring and buying clothes using a Tinder-like feature for horizontal scrolling, allowing users to swipe right or left to indicate interest. The project also includes a streak maintenance feature and a trends analysis page.

Features:
1. Horizontal Scrolling for Products:
    - Users can swipe right or left on products, and the data is used to identify the latest trends.

2. Streak Maintenance System:
    - Users can maintain a streak by exploring new ideas daily. A streak of 30 days unlocks exclusive benefits.

3. Trend Analysis:
    - A button in the navigation bar redirects users to the `visuals.html` page, which displays trends analysis.
